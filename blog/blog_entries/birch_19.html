          <h3>Systems Science | December 27th, 2018</h3>
            <article>
              We take what we see in cognitive perception to be simply
              material objects which we encounter directly through the
              senses...The error of empiricism is that it mistakes meaning
              for a sensory object, a mistake that has been recognized by
              Owen Barfield as an instance of idolotry. <br><br>

           <h3>Experiments vs. Experience | January 1st, 2019</h3>
            <article>
              What are usually passed off as "experiments" in science
              education are in really "demonstrations". The student is
              encouraged to think that this is how the discovery was first
              made...but this is an inversion which amounts to a sleight of
              hand which hides the dimension of mind and makes it appear
              to be empirical.<br> <br>

            <h3>Identification as Georesonance | January 5, 2019</h3>
             <article>
               The time seems near, if it has not actually arrived, when
               the mournful sublimity of a moor, a sea, or a mountain will
               be all of nature that is absolutely in keeping with the moods
               of the more thinking among mankind.

            <h3>Sex: Random Rules | January 6, 2019</h3>
             <article>
               When jealousy and sexual fatigue cooperate as they
               often do, the strength of the anti-sexual passion may
               become very great. I think this is the main reason
               why ascetism is apt to grow up in very licentious
               societies.

            <h3>Father State | January 7, 2019</h3>
             <article>
                Among human beings the cooperation of the father
                is of great biological advantage to the offspring,
                especially in unsettled times and among turbulent
                populations, but with the <b>growth of modern civilation</b>
                the role of the father is being increasingly taken over
                by the state.
