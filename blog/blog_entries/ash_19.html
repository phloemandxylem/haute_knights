              <p> This is a blog. An underwater blog that controls the seas.
              Won't get killed by 10,000 million pounds of sludge from New York
              or New Jersey. You will get a lot of book quotes though.

            For love is a strengthener of character not more by usefulness
            than by union and concord so that to every one of those who come together
            by the partnership of love, the saying of Pythagoras can be applied, that
            <i>a lover is indeed another self</i>.

            But if the eye is a separate intelligence which is called the counselor,
