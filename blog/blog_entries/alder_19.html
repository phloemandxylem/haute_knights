              <p> This is a blog. An underwater blog that controls the seas.
              Won't get killed by 10,000 million pounds of sludge from New York
              or New Jersey. You will get a lot of book quotes though.

          <h3>Book Quotes | April 10, 2019</h3>
            <article>
              Only with the breath, which is connected to man&#39s astal body
              did the ego principle enter in. Who is the Nathan Soul? What
              is the Mystery of Golgotha? Michael and Christ participate with
              each other in the cycle of the year. How? In Autumn Michael is
              dominant, likely becase Man is left to his own devices. Apostles
              referred to as earthly humanity. We gained on Astral Bodies on Old Moon.
              Christs entry into the Astral body represents victory of light forces
              over dark forces. The Esoteric Christian Easter is the first Sunday
              after the First Full Moon after the Spring Equinox. This timing takes
              into consideration the Moon, the elemental world, The Third Hierarchy, the soul.
              Also the Sun, where the 2nd hierarchy, the Spirits of Light reside.
              The third consideration is for the spring equinox which represents the
              2nd hierarchy or the Spirits of Strength. There are nine divine spiritual
              hierarchies participating in the constellation of Easter. The macrocosmic
              ego is beyond the zodiac.

              <i>Author Observation: Prokofieff places Christ beyond the zodiac.
              He states that when the blood from Christ&#39s wounds fell on the earth,
              it united him with the deepest regions of the earth, meaning that the
              earth has the potential to become a fixed star.</i>
