              <p> This is a blog. An underwater blog that controls the seas.
              Won't get killed by 10,000 million pounds of sludge from New York
              or New Jersey. You will get a lot of book quotes though.

            We take what we see in cognitive perception to be simply
            material objects which we encounter directly through the
            senses...The error of empiricism is that it mistakes meaning
            for a sensory object, a mistake that has been recognized by
            Owen Barfield as an instance of idolotry. <br> <br>

            A meditation on experience vs. experiments.

            What are usually passed off as "experiments" in science
            education are in really "demonstrations". The student is
            encouraged to think that this is how the discovery was first
            made...but this is an inversion which amounts to a sleight of
            hand which hides the dimension of mind and makes it appear
            to be empirical.<br> <br>

             The time seems near, if it has not actually arrived, when
             the mournful sublimity of a moor, a sea, or a mountain will
             be all of nature that is absolutely in keeping with the moods
             of the more thinking among mankind.
