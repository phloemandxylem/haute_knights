          <h3>Dao Studies: Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon | January 25th, 2019</h3>
            <article>
            <i>The tiger is energy and the dragon is spirit. There
            is a distinction between acquired and primal energy.
            <b>Immortal Sisters - Thomas Cleary pg. 34</b></i>
            <br><br>
            In Daoism, <b>Jing</b> is a term representing primal energy, or the body
            we are given at birth. <b>Qi</b> is breath acquired energy. <b>Shen</b>
            is human spirit. They are referred to as
            <a href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Jing_Qi_Shen">the 3 jewels</a>.
            Our animal friends, as with most religious or spiritual traditions, are used as symbols
            for the spiritual Pokemon of the psyche. Tiger's place within the 3 jewels framework would
            seem to be 'Jing' and 'Qi' while Dragon might be 'Shen'. Tiger seemingly fits the western
            'Mary' paradigm. It is yin encompassing yang or female/passive energy. Dragon is male and yang
            encompassing yin, seemingly 'Christ' spiritual nature. Yin is associated with fire as Yang is with water.
            These are two separate systems of philosophy that are not referencing identical concepts, but similar ones in my view.
            Male and Female are referenced below not as gender categories, but energy archetypes.<br><br>
            <h3>Emasculating Culture; Cymbals of the Times </h3>
            Tiger skins were donned by female <a href='http://www.maicar.com/GML/MAENADS.html'>Maenads</a>, adherents to Bacchic mysteries.
            Known as the 'raving ones', these women worshipped through banging cymbals, drinking wine, and going into ecstatic frenzy. In the Zohar,
            wine is associated with Geburah, or the left side of Judgement, which is also considered Female or passive. The Male side, Gedulah, ideally
            balances Judgement, which, for the sake of explorations in synchronicity, the male is potent but not acting in Yin or in Judgement. Judgement
            is constricting to action but necessary for new action. New births, if you will. The west typically associates Dragons with demonic or negative forces.
            The east has attached a different dominant symbolism to these creatures. It doesn't separate the divine's more mysterious Male forces, Male embracing the Feminine, from its
            powerful Male function, the action or display of Judgement. However, the western tradition hasn't always feared it's mystery symbols. Many European coats-of-arms display a dragon
            as a symbol of valour or power. Feminine power makes the Male truly more powerful and wise. Although this symbolism could be ripe for gender studies
            it is more useful for psychological introspection. Do my thoughts and actions balance? Am I putting right intent into what I do each day? Hardly.
            The Tiger and Dragon are in, but playing poker. Not copulating.
            <br><br>
            <h3>Constricting the Restrictrix</h3>
            The bible introduces us to Marys of different castes. Mary is mother of Christ, Mary is virgin, and Mary Magdalene is a whore.
            Tiger creates with Dragon. Mary provides light to the world by giving birth to Christ. Western religion is
            staunchly against the Feminine in its creative yet restrictive function; a most potent, male-like, powerful function. This restriction
            of the female to celibacy as the ideal might have enforced all sorts of repression and psychological trauma in regards to spirituality and
            especially sexuality in the west. It is strange to think that there once were temples in Norway similar to those in Japan, where statues
            of Loki stood, with an erect penis. The modern mind can digest these types of religions images in foreign culture, but there has never
            been a portrayal of Mary in coitus with G-d or Gabriel. Her conception is always protrayed as a revelation made physical, which is
            meaningful enough, but still leaves so much open for interpretation. We are generally more comfortable in acknowledging the Whore than the Mother.
            We are not acknowledging the Dragon when Tiger is constricted to mother, virgin, or whore, without a mate. Without her true Self.

            <h3>What's in It For Me?</h3>
            These two animals are <a href='http://en.daoinfo.org/wiki/Intercourse_of_Dragon_and_Tiger'>
            2 of the 4 mysterious animals</a>. They participate in a spiritual life-giving process, (a 'second birth'),
            said to take place within the individual, who has both Male and Female energy. Genetics also operate on
            an X/Y chromosome binary; we inherit a life-long testament to the Male-Female communion within our genes. This
            regenerative process can take place in the individual devoid of actual Male-Female sexual interaction.
            Some ancient systems attempting this regeneration believe this process is hyper-throttled through sexual interaction.
            Evidence is scattered throughout history. One example being the Bacchic mysteries, which incorporated 'orgia'. Yep.
            Mountain orgies. These are beyond the scope of this entry and a little controversial to boot. One can read and
            consider for themselves <a href ='https://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/ebm/ebm04.htm'>here</a>. These rites incorporate
            this ancient eastern concept, however altered they may have became. While the individual is not divorced from
            their genetic or psychological reality, by the sheer fact of living through it each day, it is possible to live
            with our reality in a way empowered by symbol and meaning, where love of Self and others takes on a new vital
            importance. We're not forcing anything, we're creating conditions for powerful self-realization and elimination
            of duality and 'who?'ality when we let these two powerful creatures act in unison<br><br>
            <i>"Although exhibiting apparently the features of an Eastern origin, they were evidently copied from the rites
                of Isis in Egypt, an idea of which, more or less correct, may be found in The Metamorphoses of Apuleius and
                The Epicurean by Thomas Moore."</i> <br><br>
