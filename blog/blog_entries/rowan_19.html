          <h3>Dao Studies: Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon | January 25th, 2019</h3>
            <article>
            The tiger is energy and the dragon is spirit. There
            is a distinction between acquired and primal energy (pg. 34).
            <br><br>
            Apricots are general symbols for awakening consciousness....
            <br> <br>
            <b>Immortal Sisters - Thomas Cleary</b>
            <br><br>
            A lapsed faux-catholic rap on dao. Tiger is Mary. It is the feminine
            energy and dragon is the male, YHVH, primal energy and spiritual nature?
            The bacchic mountain priestesses clothed with tiger skins come to mind.
            <br>
            Tiger is woman, yin, creatrix, movement, life-giver, mercury. The male
            or dragon, yang, like Shiva, is stable. <br><br>

            Tigers and Ivy symbols of Bacchic mysteries.
            <br><br>
            <br>These two animals are <a href='http://en.daoinfo.org/wiki/Intercourse_of_Dragon_and_Tiger'>
            2 of the 4 mysterious animals</a>, they participate in a spiritual
            life-giving process that doesn't depend on gender, but is said to take place
            within the individual, who has both male and female energy and genetics
            within themselves.
            <br><br>
            There is some symbolism between male and female in
            sexual interaction. There is struggle and compromise between the two generating
            more mercury - desire, tiger. Desire tiger. Love is only one battlefied within the G-d complex.
            Desire without spiritual nature? Cheetos binge.

            A meditation on experience vs. experiments.

            <article>
            What are usually passed off as "experiments" in science
            education are in really "demonstrations". The student is
            encouraged to think that this is how the discovery was first
            made...but this is an inversion which amounts to a sleight of
            hand which hides the dimension of mind and makes it appear
            to be empirical.<br> <br>

             The time seems near, if it has not actually arrived, when
             the mournful sublimity of a moor, a sea, or a mountain will
             be all of nature that is absolutely in keeping with the moods
             of the more thinking among mankind.
