          <h3>Dao Studies: Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon | January 25th, 2019</h3>
            <article>
            The tiger is energy and the dragon is spirit. There
            is a distinction between acquired and primal energy.
            <b>Immortal Sisters - Thomas Cleary pg. 34</b>
            <br><br>
            In Daoism, <b>Jing</b> is a term representing primal energy, or the body
            that we are give at birth. <b>Qi</b> is breath acquired energy. <b>Shen</b>
            is the human spirit. They are referred to as
            <a href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Jing_Qi_Shen">the 3 jewels</a>
            within Daosim. Tiger is Mary. It is the feminine
            yin energy and dragon is the male, YHVH, primal energy and potential for
            spiritual nature.
            The bacchic mountain priestesses clothed with tiger skins come to mind.
            <br>
            Tiger is woman, yin, creatrix, movement, life-giver, mercury. The male
            or dragon, yang, like Shiva, is stable. <br><br>

            Tigers and Ivy symbols of Bacchic mysteries.
            <br><br>
            <br>These two animals are <a href='http://en.daoinfo.org/wiki/Intercourse_of_Dragon_and_Tiger'>
            2 of the 4 mysterious animals</a>, they participate in a spiritual
            life-giving process that doesn't depend on gender, but is said to take place
            within the individual, who has both male and female energy. Genetics is also
            operating in an X/Y chromosome binary; we have a life-long testament to the male-female
            communion within our genes.
            <br>
            There is some symbolism between male and female in
            sexual interaction. There is struggle and compromise between the two generating
            more mercury - desire, tiger. Desire tiger.
