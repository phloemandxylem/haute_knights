              <p> This is a blog. An underwater blog that controls the seas.
              Won't get killed by 10,000 million pounds of sludge from New York
              or New Jersey. You will get a lot of book quotes though.

              We take what we see in cognitive perception to be simply
              material objects which we encounter directly through the
              senses...The error of empiricism is that it mistakes meaning
              for a sensory object, a mistake that has been recognized by
              Owen Barfield as an instance of idolotry. <br><br>

            <br><br>
            <article>
              What are usually passed off as "experiments" in science
              education are in really "demonstrations". The student is
              encouraged to think that this is how the discovery was first
              made...but this is an inversion which amounts to a sleight of
              hand which hides the dimension of mind and makes it appear
              to be empirical.<br> <br>

               The time seems near, if it has not actually arrived, when
               the mournful sublimity of a moor, a sea, or a mountain will
               be all of nature that is absolutely in keeping with the moods
               of the more thinking among mankind.

               When jealousy and sexual fatigue cooperate as they
               often do, the strength of the anti-sexual passion may
               become very great. I think this is the main reason
               why ascetism is apt to grow up in very licentious
               societies.

                Among human beings the cooperation of the father
                is of great biological advantage to the offspring,
                especially in unsettled times and among turbulent
                populations, but with the <b>growth of modern civilation</b>
                the role of the father is being increasingly take over
                by the state.

                At the end of the Gregorian month I'll lighten
                up the vibe here. I will link arts, musics, etc.
                New bands and new artists get in touch if you want
                some minimal press. Art and music shows at which
                I embarass myself will also be written up here.
